# Kolkata Bus Route

A simple, static route finder for Kolkata buses.

Kolkata moves by bus, but route information is scattered across memory, local advice, and fragmented lists. This project turns that route data into a searchable graph so people can find direct buses, one-change journeys, and two-change journeys between stops.

Live site: https://kolkata-bus-route.vercel.app

## Features

- Search by starting stop and destination stop
- Autocomplete for known bus stops
- Direct, one-change, and two-change route suggestions
- Route cards showing buses, transfers, and stop counts
- Map plotting for geocoded stops
- Vercel Web Analytics support
- Public visitor badge on the site

## Project Structure

- `kolkata-bus-router.html` - the static web app
- `index.html` - redirects the root URL to the app page
- `build.py` - parses and normalizes raw route data
- `busdata.json` - generated route dataset
- `raw_private.txt` - raw private bus route source data
- `raw_govt.txt` - raw government bus route source data
- `vercel.json` - Vercel static hosting configuration

## Run Locally

Because the app is static, you can open `kolkata-bus-router.html` directly in a browser.

For a local server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then visit:

```text
http://localhost:8080/kolkata-bus-router.html
```

## Rebuild Data

After editing route sources:

```bash
python3 build.py
```

This regenerates `busdata.json`. If you change the dataset, make sure the app's embedded `DATA` object is refreshed before deploying.

## Deploy

The site is deployed on Vercel as a static project.

```bash
vercel deploy --prod
```

## Analytics

The app includes Vercel Web Analytics:

```html
<script defer src="/_vercel/insights/script.js"></script>
```

Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel project dashboard to see detailed visitor data. The public visitor count shown on the page uses a lightweight external badge.
